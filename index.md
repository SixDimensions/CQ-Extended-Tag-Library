## CQ Extended Tag Library

CQ Extended Taglibs is a library of tag and Expression Language functions for the Adobe 
CQ5 platform. These tags expose commonly used methods and utilities as JSP Tags and EL 
Functions.

### Why do I need this?

CQ Extended Taglibs allow developers to write cleaner and less error-prone CQ5 components 
by enabling them to use the power and flexibility of Sling and CQ5 with Tags and EL 
Functions.

### How do I use the tags?

All of the tags use the cqex namespace. For more information on the available tags and 
functions and how to utilize them, please consult the documentation page.
